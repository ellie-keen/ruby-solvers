require_relative './taxi.rb'# this line allows you to use your Taxi class 

# This class should:

#  - have a read attribute called car_park
#  - car_park should be an empty array by default
#    set this in the INITIALIZE method
#  - have a method called park, which takes a Taxi as an argument,
#    and adds it to the car_park array
#  - have a method called release_taxi, which will remove the last
#    taxi object from the car_park array and return that taxi
